# Overview

Supervised learning techniques designed for the situation when the dimensionality exceeds the sample size have a tendency to overfit as the dimensionality of the data increases. To remedy this high dimensionality; low sample size (HDLSS) situation, we attempt to learn a lower-dimensional representation of the data before learning a classifier. That is, we project the data to a situation where the dimensionality is more manageable, and then we are able to better apply standard classification or clustering techniques since we will have fewer dimensions to overfit. A number of previous works have focused on how to strategically reduce dimensionality in the unsupervised case, yet in the supervised HDLSS regime, few works have attempted to devise dimensionality reduction techniques that leverage the labels associated with the data. In this package, we provide several methods for feature extraction, some utilizing labels and some not, along with easily extensible utilities to simplify cross-validative efforts to identify the best feature extraction method. Additionally, we include a series of adaptable benchmark simulations to serve as a standard for future investigative efforts into supervised HDLSS. Finally, we produce a comprehensive comparison of the included algorithms across a range of benchmark simulations and real data applications.

# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

The `lol` package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the operations defined by a user. For minimal performance, this will be a computer with about 2 GB of RAM. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

RAM: 16+ GB  
CPU: 4+ cores, 3.3+ GHz/core

The runtimes below are generated using a computer with the recommended specs (16 GB RAM, 4 cores@3.3 GHz) and internet of speed 25 Mbps.

## Software Requirements

### OS Requirements

The package development version is tested on *Linux* operating systems. The developmental version of the package has been tested on the following systems:

Linux: Ubuntu 16.04  
Mac OSX:  
Windows:  

The CRAN package should be compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

Before setting up the `lolR` package, users should have `R` version 3.4.0 or higher, and several packages set up from CRAN.

#### Installing R version 3.4.2 on Ubuntu 16.04

the latest version of R can be installed by adding the latest repository to `apt`:

```
sudo echo "deb http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key E084DAB9
gpg -a --export E084DAB9 | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev
```

which should install in about 20 seconds.
